- Dataset cleaned and prepped for analysis
- Calculating key metrics with Excel functions
- To summarise sales results, use pivot tables and charts.
- Examination of product categories, sales patterns, and sources of income
- Information that clarifies which goods, markets, or time periods have the most effects on overall performance
This project demonstrates useful Excel abilities for real-world data analysis and may be used as a guide for creating dashboards, compiling sales data, and using Excel to obtain business insights.

**What this project illustrates**
- Excel data preparation and transformation
- Utilising sophisticated formulas (such as LOOKUPs and SUMIFS)
- Making a pivot table to slice and summarise data
